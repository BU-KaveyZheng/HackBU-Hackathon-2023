I wanted to make an iOS app because many times, phone apps are ignored in favor of web development even though phones account for 90% of internet traffic. This app has realize for college students like me by bringing studying into the electronic era.

Users can create/edit flashcards and use them like any other flashcard except electronically. All parts of the app from loading screens to buttons have assets to make the app UI more understandable. Users can also play a tile matching mini game if they get bored of studying, but still want to improve their memory.
